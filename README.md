ðŸ‘‹ Hi everybody!  
My name's Andrew. Igloo comes from my grandfather's name, Iglinski. I recently took 9 months away from my freelance work to focus on writing a paper related to my education, physics. That paper's currently under review in the _Journal of Mathematical Physics_ as of 10/24/2022. I'm excited to get back to work in the field that provided me the free time to pursue such a lofty goal.  
  
To sum up the paper, I believe I can demonstrate that Earth's peculiar (or total) velocity relative to the cosmic rest reference frame can be found from Einstein's work which get resolved to the following equation.

$$
\begin{equation}
v_o = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{g}{r}\right)^2}} \approx 526.6\ \text{km}\ \text{s}^{-1}
\end{equation}
$$

I work primarily with React, **Node.js** and most often **Express** coupled with **MongoDB**. While researching this paper I worked almost exclusively with **Python**, and I've written a bit of **Swift** in the past.  
  
- I love to be challenged. I'm definitely guilty of becoming bored easily when I'm not challenged to learn new things, but when I'm working on a challenging task I can focus for days on end.  

- I love the idea of working for an organization that is really doing good in the world. I'd work for half the money if I really believe in the mission of who I'm working for.
- Given the current state of the world, I can't imagine working for someone that doesn't share my values. 
  - Equality in all forms
  - Democracy
  - Science, Math and Logic
  - _Philia_ [^1]: Concern for others, even if that doesn't directly  benefit yourself.  
     

I'd feel dishonest if I didn't mention this upfront: As of writing this on 10/26/2022 I submitted this paper for publication yesterday, 10/25/2022. I gave up a really nice 2 year old apartment with a brand new kitchen, all brand new appliances, a balcony and a lake view to live in my Chevy Sonic with my puppy so I could focus on writing this paper without distraction. I still have access to a solid internet connection all day, but in the short term working in an office isn't really possible, as this princess has to go everywhere with me.
