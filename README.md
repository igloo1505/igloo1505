ðŸ‘‹ Hi everybody!  
My name's Andrew. Igloo comes from my grandfather's last name, Iglinski. One evening a little over two years ago, I was reading over some of Einstein's work for probably the 15th time, when something occurred to me. He made an assumption that only made sense in the days before our observations of cosmic inflation.

If we discounted this assumption, we an produce every single experimental validation of both the specialized and generalized theories of relativity
