ðŸ‘‹ Hi everybody!  
My name's Andrew. Igloo comes from my grandfather's last name, Iglinski. I recently took over a year away from my freelance work to focus on writing a paper related to my education, physics. I've began accepting work again over the past few months, but I'm definitely interested in finding the right company who's focus and ethics align with my own. I've spent the past 18 months taking endless notes, generating hundreds of plots, and digging back through previous notes trying to find that thing I thought was so brilliant 3 months prior, all while being offline most of the summer. That gave me a great appreciation for projects like Jupyter and different plotting libraries, but I feel like I can be a great addition to any team working with the note taking / academic type of projects because trust me, I've struggled with every issue these projects have to the point that I found it easier to ust build my own. That isn't to say that those apps aren't great, and in fact I use many of them within my own app, but building an app that's simple enough for middle school students to use, or a chef to use for keeping track of his recipes in the same app that can handle his restaurants business data, yet capable of taking every type of note that a PhD physicist or MD candidate would want to take has been my focus for the past few months. Originally I was building this app for my own personal use, but as it grew to fit every use case that I needed for my own research, I quickly realized that this app could benefit students, researchers, small business owners, bloggers, and just every day people that want to journal, keep track of their fitness data, or digitize their grandmothers recipes.

The paper is finally being wrapped up. I'll being submitting it for peer review within the next couple days (as of 11-1-2023), and I'll be publishing it in preprint at the same time. I'm beyond excited about the results of this paper, but I'm excited to get back to work in the field that provided me the free time to pursue such a lofty goal. No matter how impactful this paper turns out to be, I would have never been able to complete it if I hadn't already had experience writing code.  
To sum up the paper, I believe I can demonstrate that Earth's peculiar (or total) velocity relative to the cosmic rest reference frame can be found through Einstein's work. Through some rather adventurous geometry and some pretty elementary math, the paper proposes that our PV can be found through this equation. Interestingly, this seems to fit very cohesively with data found through direct observation of both Supernovae luminosity curves and the cosmic microwave background radiation.

$$
\begin{equation}
v_o = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{g}{r}\right)^2}} \approx 526.6\ \text{km}\ \text{s}^{-1}
\end{equation}
$$

What also pops out of this geometry I proposed is the fact that this equation, where $R_p$ is the Earth's polar radius, $R_e$ is Earth's equatorial radius, $S_d$ is Earth's rotation period in seconds in respect to the Sun, and $g$ is Earth's gravitational acceleration at sea level, is not a coincidence. Current models predict no relationship between the equations $f^1$ and $f^2$ or $f^3$, but the geometry I proposed gives a direct derviation.

$$
f^1 = c \left(\frac{g}{R_e}\right)
$$

$$
f^2 = \left(\frac{2 \pi R_p}{c S_d}\right)
$$

$$
f^3 = \left(\frac{2 \pi R_e}{c S_d}\right)
$$

It turns out that $f^1 \approx f^2$ and an even better approximation, when ignoring the effects of centripital force on the radius, $f^1 \approx f^3$.

$$
\frac{c \left(\frac{g}{R_e}\right)}{\left(\frac{2 \pi R_p}{c S_d}\right)} = 1.0028
$$

And if ignoring the centripital force effects on the equatorial radius, giving an error of $0.047%$:

$$
\frac{c \left(\frac{g}{R_e}\right)}{\left(\frac{2 \pi R_e}{c S_d}\right)} = 1.00047
$$



As for the technologies that I'm most familiar with, I've worked with React and Node for around 8 years, Python for the last few years and had little spurts of Lua and Swift mixed in there as well. As my last little life journey might indicate, I can be a bit ADHD at times and that leads me to constantly search for new challenges and things to learn. When it comes to tech, if a job prospect doesn't take me down another path Rust is likely next up on my list, with Kotlin following shortly.  

Now that I've checked this paper off of my bucket list, if anyone is looking for a React, Node, or Python developer please reach out, especially if your focus is in the education or academic world. I need to buy treats for this princess...
