ðŸ‘‹ Hi everybody!  
My name's Andrew. Igloo comes from my grandfather's last name, Iglinski. I recently took a year away from my freelance work to focus on writing a paper related to my education, physics. That was recently accepted to be published in the _Journal of Mathematical Physics_, and I'm excited to get back to work in the field that provided me the free time to pursue such a lofty goal. No matter how impactful this paper turns out to be, I would have never been able to complete it if I hadn't already had experience writing code.  
To sum up the paper, I believe I can demonstrate that Earth's peculiar (or total) velocity relative to the cosmic rest reference frame can be found through Einstein's work. Through some rather adventurous geometry and some pretty elementary math, the paper proposes that our PV can be found through this equation:  

$$
\begin{equation}
v_o = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{g}{r}\right)^2}} \approx 526.6\ \text{km}\ \text{s}^{-1}
\end{equation}
$$

As for the technologies that I'm most familiar with, I've worked with React and Node for around 8 years, Python for the last few years and had little spurts of Lua and Swift mixed in there as well. As my last little life journey might indicate, I can be a bit ADHD at times and that leads me to constantly search for new challenges and things to learn. When it comes to tech, if a job prospect doesn't take me down another path Rust is likely next up on my list, with Kotlin following shortly.  

Now that I've checked this paper off of my bucket list, if anyone is looking for a React, Node, or Python developer please reach out. I need to buy treats for this princess...
