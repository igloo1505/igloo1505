ðŸ‘‹ Hi everybody!  
My name's Andrew. Igloo comes from my grandfather's name, Iglinski. I recently took 9 months away from my freelance work to focus on writing a paper related to my education, physics. That paper's currently under review in the _Journal of Mathematical Physics_ as of 10/24/2022. I'm excited to get back to work in the field that provided me the free time to pursue such a lofty goal. No matter how impactful this paper turns out to be, I would have never been able to complete it if I hadn't already had experience writing code.
  
To sum up the paper, I believe I can demonstrate that Earth's peculiar (or total) velocity relative to the cosmic rest reference frame can be found through Einstein's work. Through some rather adventurous geometry and some pretty elementary math, the paper proposes that our PV can be found through this equation[^2]:

$$
\begin{equation}
v_o = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{g}{r}\right)^2}} \approx 526.6\ \text{km}\ \text{s}^{-1}
\end{equation}

## Now the software stuff:

I work primarily with **React**, **Node.js** and most often **Express** coupled with **MongoDB**. While researching this paper I worked almost exclusively with **Python**, and I've written a bit of **Swift** in the past.  
  
- I love to be challenged. I'm definitely guilty of becoming bored at times when I'm not challenged to learn new things, but when I'm working on a challenging task or something I truly believe in I sometimes find it difficult to put my work down at the end of the day.

- I love the idea of working for an organization that is really doing good in the world. I'd work for half the money if I really believe in the mission of who I'm working for.
- Given the current state of the world, I can't imagine working for someone that doesn't share my values. 
  - Equality in all forms
  - Democracy
  - Science, Math and Logic

### Caveat
I'd feel dishonest if I didn't mention this upfront: As of writing this on 10/26/2022 I submitted this paper for publication yesterday, 10/25/2022. I gave up a really nice 2 year old apartment with a brand new kitchen, all brand new appliances, a balcony and a lake view to live in my Chevy Sonic with my puppy so I could focus on writing this paper without distraction. I still have access to a solid internet connection all day, but in the short term working in an office isn't really possible, as this princess has to go everywhere with me.
